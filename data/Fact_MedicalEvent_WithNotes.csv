Furthermore, the patient was found to have dried blood under the left foot 5th toenail, along with a small 0.2x0.2cm skin tear on the left 4th toe, and a superficial skin tear measuring 0.1x0.1x<0.1cm on the right shin. The patient mentioned bumping himself in the gym earlier in the day and scratching his leg.

Additionally, during a transfer from the toilet to a chair, another resident was assessed to have a skin tear on the left forearm, measuring 5.5cm x 4cm x 0.1cm, with a half-moon shape skin flap and scant bleeding. The patient denied experiencing any pain, and it was reported that the incident occurred with the assistance of a CNA and another individual. The medical team was promptly notified, leading to the application of steri strips, xeroform cover, abdominal pad, and a kling wrap, with a wound consult arranged. The patient's daughter was informed about the situation.

Moreover, a resident who had been sent to the ER for agitation during the night returned with a bruise and skin tear. Prior to this incident, the patient's skin was intact as per the last weekly observation. The patient disclosed to a care attendant that the wound on the back of his hand was self-inflicted, resulting from catching his hand on the bedside table. The skin tear, measuring 1cm x 1cm between the 2nd and 3rd knuckles, prompted the initiation of the skin tear protocol.

Lastly, a skin tear was sustained by a resident during a transfer with a Hoyer lift. The patient accidentally hit his right hand on the mechanical lift machine, resulting in a 5cm x 3.5cm skin tear with a scant amount of bleeding. Treatment was administered, and the APN was notified, leading to an order for daily application of Xeroform until healing. The patient's daughter was updated during her visit.

In light of the positive evaluation indicating a mild injury requiring first aid, the patient was provided with a walker for support. Additionally, the patient's prescription for Metformin Tablet 500 MG, initiated on February 15, 2025, was noted to be ongoing. The microbiological evaluation revealed a colony count of 50,000 mixed flora with three or more species present, with the etiology identified as community-acquired and the organism as Enterococcus faecalis. Close monitoring and appropriate wound care measures were implemented to ensure optimal healing and prevent any complications."

A skin tear, measuring approximately 1cm x 1.4cm, was noted along with discoloration in the area. The patient reported experiencing an ulcer at the site, which was determined to have been caused during a transfer incident. It was speculated that the skin tear might have occurred due to the patient's movement while sitting on a wheelchair, as the tear was at the same level as where the leg rest would typically be positioned.

Furthermore, the patient was found to have sustained a sheered skin tear on the right lower leg during the transfer process. The injury was promptly addressed, and first aid was administered. The safety precaution taken was deemed to be insufficient, as no specific measures were in place to prevent such incidents.

In light of the medical event detail revealing a colony count of 100,000+ gram-positive cocci in chains, with the organism identified as Enterococcus faecalis, the evaluation of the situation was deemed inconclusive. The etiology was determined to be in-house, indicating that the infection likely originated within the healthcare facility.

As part of the treatment plan, the patient was prescribed Metformin Tablet 500 MG, to be taken indefinitely starting from February 15, 2025. Close monitoring and follow-up care were recommended to address the skin tear and ulcer effectively.
