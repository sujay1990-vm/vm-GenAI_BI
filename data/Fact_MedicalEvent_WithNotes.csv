Furthermore, the patient was found to have a skin tear on the right outer ankle. The occupational therapist was called to evaluate a larger skin tear on the left forearm, measuring 5.5cm x 4cm x 0.1cm, with a half-moon shape skin flap and scant bleeding. The patient denied experiencing any pain and mentioned that the injury occurred during a transfer from the toilet to a chair, with assistance from a caregiver and a certified nursing assistant.

Orders were received to apply Xeroform daily until the wound heals. The resident's daughter, Diane, was informed during her visit at dinner time.

In light of these events, it is crucial to ensure proper wound care and monitoring for signs of infection. The resident's safety should be prioritized, with the use of a walker to aid in mobility.

Lastly, during a transfer with a Hoyer lift, the patient accidentally hit their right hand on the mechanical lift machine, resulting in a 5cm x 3.5cm skin tear with a scant amount of bleeding. Treatment was administered, and the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) was notified, ordering the application of Xeroform daily until healing. The patient's daughter was updated on the situation during a visit. 

In light of the patient's medical history, including a significant elevation in white blood cell count, the abrasions and skin tears are being closely monitored to prevent any complications.

A skin tear, measuring approximately 1cm x 1.4cm, was noted along with discoloration in the area. The patient reported experiencing an ulcer at the site, which was determined to have been caused during a transfer incident. It was speculated that the skin tear might have occurred due to the patient's movement while sitting on a wheelchair, as the tear was at the same level as where the leg rest would typically be positioned.

Furthermore, the patient was found to have sustained a sheered skin tear on the right lower leg during the transfer process. The injury was promptly addressed, and first aid was administered. The safety precaution taken was deemed to be insufficient, as no specific measures were in place to prevent such incidents.

In light of the medical event detail revealing a colony count of 100,000+ gram-positive cocci in chains, with the organism identified as Enterococcus faecalis, the evaluation of the situation was deemed inconclusive. The etiology was determined to be in-house, indicating that the infection likely originated within the healthcare facility.

As part of the treatment plan, the patient was prescribed Metformin Tablet 500 MG, to be taken indefinitely starting from February 15, 2025. Close monitoring and follow-up care were recommended to address the skin tear and ulcer effectively.
