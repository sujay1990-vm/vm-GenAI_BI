Medical bills are being evaluated, but you may need to coordinate with third-party insurance since there's litigation involved. \\nCustomer: Okay, but I'm confused about the process. I've been contacted by other parties, and they're giving me conflicting information. \\nAgent: That's likely due to the subrogation opportunity. I'll pass this along to the legal team to clarify.

Medical bills are being evaluated, but you may need to coordinate with third-party insurance since there's litigation involved. \\nCustomer: Okay, but I'm confused about the process. I've been contacted by other parties, and they're giving me conflicting information. \\nAgent: That's likely due to the subrogation opportunity. I'll pass this along to the legal team to clarify.
