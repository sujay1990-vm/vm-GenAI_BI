      "The **threshold value for total loss** typically refers to the point at which the cost of repairing a damaged vehicle exceeds a certain percentage of its pre-accident market value. This is often referred to as the **Total Loss Threshold (TLT)**. While the retrieved documents do not specify a fixed percentage or dollar amount for total loss, here are some general industry practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Percentage-Based Threshold**:\n",
      "   - Many states and insurers use a percentage of the vehicle's Actual Cash Value (ACV) to determine total loss. For example, if the repair costs exceed 70-80% of the vehicle's ACV, the vehicle may be declared a total loss.\n",
      "   - This percentage varies by state. For instance:\n",
      "     - In some states, the threshold is as low as 50%.\n",
      "     - In others, it can go up to 80% or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Soft Thresholds**:\n",
      "   - The $3,500 soft threshold mentioned in the documents is used as a guideline for borderline total losses. This means that vehicles with repair estimates exceeding $3,500 may be flagged for further review to determine if they qualify as total losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Factors Influencing Total Loss Determination**:\n",
      "   - **Market Value of the Vehicle**: The pre-accident value of the vehicle plays a significant role. Older or less valuable vehicles are more likely to be declared total losses even with relatively minor damage.\n",
      "   - **Salvage Value**: The potential resale value of the damaged vehicle as salvage is also considered.\n",
      "   - **Extent of Damage**: Structural damage, deployed airbags, or damage to critical components like the engine or frame can push a vehicle toward total loss status.\n",
